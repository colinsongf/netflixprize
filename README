This was draft python code for the Netflix Competition. I moved on to C after playing around with this code for a bit.


No idea what the status on this code, I don't even know if it runs.
The algorithm is there though. The results should be around 0.96 RMSE.

The first version ran locally. Later I played around with a Producer/Consumer distributed architecture.
